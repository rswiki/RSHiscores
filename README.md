# RSHiscores

A MediaWiki extension that provides easy access to [RuneScape's Hiscores](http://services.runescape.com/m=hiscore/overview) for use in wikitext and JS calculators. Originally designed for the [RuneScape Wiki](http://runescape.wikia.com).

Issues and pull requests should filed [here](https://github.com/TehKittyCat/RSHiscores). However, the version used by [Wikia](http://www.wikia.com) (and the RuneScape Wiki) might be behind this version. For the version used by Wikia see [here](https://github.com/Wikia/app/tree/dev/extensions/3rdparty/RSHighscores). Alternatively, see [Special:Version](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Version) on RuneScape Wiki.

# Installation

1. Clone this repository to the extensions directory of your MediaWiki install.
2. Add the following to your `LocalSettings.php`
```php
// RSHiscores
require_once( 'extensions/RSHiscores/RSHighscores.php' );

/**
 * You may set $wgRSLimit in LocalSettings.php to adjust the maximum number of
 * names allowed to be called per page. Setting to 0 removes the limit.
 * If more than $wgRSLimit calls are made, then 'E' is returned for the name
 * calls over the limit. This example allows for 2 name calls to {{#hs}}.
 */
$wgRSLimit = 2;
```
